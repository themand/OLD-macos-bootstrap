# macos-bootstrap

This is a set of scripts which I use to bootstrap a new mac. Settings are tailored for my needs and won't suit everyone.

#### Usage

```bash
curl -sSLo macos-bootstrap-master.tar.gz https://github.com/themand/macos-bootstrap/archive/master.tar.gz
tar zxf macos-bootstrap-master.tar.gz
macos-bootstrap-master/bootstrap.sh
```

#### Cleanup

```bash
rm -r macos-bootstrap-master macos-bootstrap-master.tar.gz
```

#### Next steps

Not everything can be automated or I did not bother to automate everything. Proceed to [list of manual steps](MANUAL.md) to perform on a new mac.
